OptionsPlot
===========

OptionsPlot downloads options quotes from Yahoo! Finance and uses the <a href="http://finance.bi.no/~bernt/gcc_prog/"> Financial Numercial Recipes C++ library</a> to calculate implied volatilities and other basic options analysis. PFGPlots (Latex) is used to plot the volatility smile and a few other simple plots. OptionsPlot will create a directory (OptionsPlot) in the user's home directory where any generated PDF reports will be saved. See ORCL_OptionsPlot.pdf for an example.

Installation:
